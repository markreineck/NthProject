This is correct. However if you click on them the little window that has their grade and school info does always says volunteer.\r\n\r\nThe correct operation is that a (vol) person should have Volunteer show up in the info box. The same person as a student should have their grade and school info appear. \r\n\r\nMR: A little background... This kiosk is used to check in both students and volunteers. The procedure for checking in a student is a little different than for checking in a volunteer. It requires a different label and also a different stored procedure call to do the check-in.\r\n\r\nWhen you type letters into the last name field in step1.php and it fills the list it will indicate which ones are volunteers. Here is the issue: some kids are both a student and a volunteer. In this case they will show up in the list twice, once with (Vol) next to their name and once without it. If you click the name without (Vol) it should check them in as a student. If you click the one with (Vol) you should check them in as a volunteer. You can see this on line 82 in step1.php where we are showing them on the page differently.\r\n\r\nCurrently what the logic is doing is using the age. If a person is an adult then they must be a volunteer. But this logic will erroneously check in everyone who is not an adult as a student.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to do is tag the volunteers in the list as volunteers so that when a name is selected we can recognize that it was a volunteer. There are 3 options that I can think of to do this.\r\n\r\n1. Look for the (Vol) string at the end of the name in the list.\r\n2. The id number is what is placed in the value for each list option. We could encode these differently for volunteers (make volunteers negative or prefic the id with a V).\r\n3. In the descoverlyand kiosks Juluis used a different class for each option in the list to indicate what type of entry it was (in that case he was differentiating between members and guests). \r\n\r\nI am thinking using negative ids for volunteers is the easiest but I will leave it up to you. It is a reasonable assumption that if you can make the logic on line 82 show the person correctly that they will be checked in correctly. Or at least it is a good place to start. If that does not fix the entire problem then talk to me about it.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of names that you can use that will show up as both a volunteer and a student:\r\n\r\nJason Michael Koontz\r\nElise Louise Mills\r\nAndrew Kutcher'),
